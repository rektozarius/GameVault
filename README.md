# GameVault App

GameVault is a web application designed for gamers who want to explore detailed information about their favorite video games. By leveraging the [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs), GameVault allows users to search for games, view comprehensive details, and discover trending titles.

## Design

GameVault mimics the color/brand [palette](https://discord.com/branding) of Discord App.

## Usage
